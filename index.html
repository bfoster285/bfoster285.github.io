  <p class="italic">Domain 2 - The Classroom Environment</p>

  <p>Creating a classroom environment that supports meaningful learning begins with establishing respect and rapport. I will prioritize building strong relationships by actively listening to students, acknowledging their perspectives, and modeling respect in all interactions. Small shifts in teacher language, such as replacing directives with invitations or explanations, help students feel valued and increase engagement (ASCD, n.d.). I will communicate high expectations while providing consistent support, encouraging students in Honors and AP classes to take intellectual risks and guiding regular classes to build confidence and growth. These strategies align with PTR Core Practices that emphasize positive communication and relationship-building as foundational to learning.</p>

  <p>Establishing a culture for learning requires consistency and modeling of appropriate behaviors. I will make expectations for participation, collaboration, and effort clear from the first day and reinforce them daily. According to Ferlazzo (2008), when a class begins to lose focus or momentum, openly addressing issues and collaboratively reflecting with students helps restore trust and engagement. I will model problem-solving and responsibility, demonstrating that challenges are opportunities for growth rather than setbacks. Creating this consistent, reflective culture will help all students feel safe and supported while taking academic risks.</p>

  <p>I will use intentional classroom organization to maximize learning and collaboration. Flexible grouping strategies will be tailored to lesson objectives, including small-group discussions and peer-led analysis in Honors and AP classes, and a balance of group and independent tasks in regular classes. Seating arrangements will be adjusted according to instructional goals, promoting discussion and focus when needed. Clear routines for transitions, group work, and independent practice will help students know what to expect and reduce downtime. This organization aligns with PTR Core Practices that focus on creating structured, predictable learning environments.</p>

  <p>Physical and social organization will also support engagement and accountability. I will establish clear classroom norms collaboratively with students, including expectations for participation, discussion, and respect. Group roles and responsibilities will be assigned intentionally to ensure equitable participation and peer support. Regular check-ins and reflection activities will encourage students to evaluate their own contributions and interactions. This structure reinforces a culture where students take ownership of both their learning and the classroom community.</p>

  <p>Positive teacher language will be a critical tool in maintaining a respectful, productive environment. I will emphasize encouragement, acknowledgment, and constructive feedback rather than punitive or controlling statements. ASCD (n.d.) highlights that small changes in teacher talk can dramatically improve student engagement, motivation, and trust. By consistently framing challenges as opportunities and celebrating effort alongside achievement, I will foster a growth-oriented classroom. This practice supports the PTR Core Practice of using respectful, clear, and purposeful teacher communication.</p>

  <p>Addressing disruptions proactively is essential for sustaining a productive learning environment. I will respond calmly and reflectively to off-task behavior, seeking to understand underlying causes rather than defaulting to punitive measures. Ferlazzo (2008) emphasizes that when classes “go bad,” repairing relationships and restoring routines collaboratively can return the class to a positive trajectory. I will model self-regulation and empathy while reinforcing behavioral expectations. This approach ensures that the classroom remains a space conducive to meaningful learning for all students.</p>

  <p>Finally, these strategies will collectively enhance teaching and learning across all my classes. A classroom grounded in respect, clear routines, and intentional organization allows students to focus on reading, writing, and discussion rather than procedural confusion. Positive teacher talk and relationship-building increase student engagement and willingness to tackle complex texts (ASCD, n.d.). Collaborative reflection and flexible grouping strategies help students develop critical thinking, communication, and interpersonal skills. Altogether, these practices create an environment that fosters confidence, growth, and active participation in every classroom.</p>

  <h3>1. Content and Standards</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RL.9-10.1: Cite strong and thorough textual evidence to support analysis of what the text says explicitly as well as inferences drawn from the text.</li>
    <li>CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RL.9-10.2: Determine a theme or central idea of a text and analyze in detail its development over the course of the text.</li>
    <li>CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RL.9-10.3: Analyze how complex characters develop over the course of a text, interact with other characters, and advance the plot.</li>
    <li>CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.SL.9-10.1: Initiate and participate effectively in a range of collaborative discussions with diverse partners.</li>
    <li>Objective-aligned materials: Excerpts from <span class="italic">The Joy Luck Club</span>, discussion prompts, TPT strategy tools (whiteboards, digital polling, or sticky notes).</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2. Prerequisites</h3>

  <p>Conditions: Following a guided discussion<br>
     Action verb: write and share<br>
     Measurable outcome: at least three textual examples per student demonstrating comprehension and analysis</p>

  <h3>6. Instructional Procedures</h3>

  <h4>Before (Anticipatory Set / Mini Lesson)</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Begin with a quick review of the book, highlighting key mother-daughter relationships.</li>
    <li>Pose an essential question on the board: “How do our parents’ experiences shape who we become?”</li>
    <li>Explain the TPT strategy for the lesson: all students will participate using whiteboards/sticky notes to answer prompts.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>During (Group Work / Independent Practice)</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Step 1: Individual Think Time - Students write 2-3 textual examples of mother-daughter influence on their whiteboards/sticky notes.</li>
    <li>Step 2: Quick Share (TPT) - Teacher calls on students randomly to share answers, ensuring all responses are considered.</li>
    <li>Step 3: Partner Discussion - Students compare answers with a partner and refine their textual evidence.</li>
    <li>Step 4: Group Synthesis - Pairs combine answers into a class chart/projected document highlighting patterns across the book.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>After (Closure / Assessment)</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Students reflect in a 5-minute written response on which mother-daughter interaction they found most significant and why, citing evidence.</li>
    <li>Teacher reviews whiteboards/sticky notes and class chart for comprehension.</li>
    <li>Quick verbal recap: highlight recurring themes or insights students found.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>7. Assessment</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Formative: Check individual whiteboards/sticky notes for textual evidence and understanding.</li>
    <li>Summative: Review written reflections for clarity, accuracy, and use of evidence.</li>
    <li>Participation: Track TPT responses to ensure all students engaged.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>8. Differentiated Instruction</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Support: Provide sentence starters or exemplar textual evidence for students needing scaffolding.</li>
    <li>Challenge: Ask advanced students to analyze how cultural context influences mother-daughter relationships and compare with their own experiences.</li>
    <li>Process Differentiation: Allow students to respond digitally or on paper depending on learning preference.</li>
    <li>Product Differentiation: Some students may create visual representations of relationships instead of written summaries.</li>
  </ul>
